* Greeting: polite, it can be formal. It is depends on addressee status and level of your relationship.
* Main idea: one-two rows about the main purpose of your message (request, complaint).
* Body: include only one topic into one e-mail. The used style depends on the culture of the addressee.
* Appreciation: the right words for this section are “*I wish…*”, “*I am very grateful…*”. You can repeat your main question or request but use others words.

## Some of the features of e-mail parts:
* The structure of e-mails should be the same but their content is depends on culture and situation.
* You should use common language for example “**Simplified English**”. Emoticons and professional slang can be used if this not a first message.
* Subject should be concrete — for example order number, main topic, your name. Without “*a*”, “*the*” articles, like a title of article. Your subject line should attract attention of addressee because he can receive a huge amount of e-mails.
* Write greeting in the separate line and add an empty line after it. Take into account the gender of your addressee in the greeting.
* Use bulleted or numbered lists in the body of e-mail. Separate one paragraph from another. This can simplify the reading of message. If your e-mail has an attachment, then write about this fact in the body of message.
* Your appreciation should be sincere. Control please the “*copy-paste*” phrases. If you cannot be sincere, then wait for a minute, take a pause and come back to your e-mail.
* Signature: use your official address not private for example *pussycat@catlovers.com*
